# linux-gpib
Updated linux-gpib kernel driver and user utilities.

This builds upon the work of https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/vddvss/linux-gpib/ in packaging the linux-gpib driver for Fedora. It updates the RPMs for Fedora 37 & 38 and to the latest linux-gpib driver (SVN 2052) and user utilities.
